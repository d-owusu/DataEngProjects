using databricks, I analyse the freely available movielens dataset using azure databricks.
- Start with creating resource group and creating storage containers
- Create a pipeline to copy the data into the container using Azure data factory
- Then create an instance in databricks . Since i was using the free trial , i found it difficult getting a freely availble node in my cluster at my current  location . 
- Attach the cluster and then  start the notebook
